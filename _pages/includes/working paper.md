## Catalysts of Governance Convergence: The Influence of Foreign Ownership on the Change of Corporate Governance System 
_Last updated: June 2025_
This study investigates how foreign institutional investors influence the structural transformation of corporate governance (CG) systems in Japan, a stakeholder-oriented economy. We examine whether Anglo-American foreign ownership increases the likelihood of firms adopting the U.S.-style “audit committee” system, replacing Japan’s traditional dual-board “auditor board” system. Our findings indicate that active foreign investors, particularly from Anglo-American governance systems where unitary boards with audit committees are the norm, play a pivotal role in driving this transition. The effect is amplified in firms with high information asymmetry, where enhanced board oversight can mitigate governance risks. Conversely, firms that are deeply embedded in Japan’s traditional governance model, characterized by cross-shareholdings and long-term employment ties, exhibit stronger resistance to CG system change. Finally, we find that the adoption of the audit committee system is not merely symbolic when active foreign ownership is high. Rather than making superficial adjustments, firms substantively enhance board independence, signaling meaningful governance reform beyond baseline compliance requirements.
